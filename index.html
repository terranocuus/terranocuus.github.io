# One Day I'll Update This
##### #srslytho #probablynot

I am a bit slow on the uptake in regards to Github; this is mostly due to every workplace using Subversion for its' version control system. Someday, when I get more time to think about it all, maybe I'll get some more code posted here.

In the meantime, thanks for visiting.
